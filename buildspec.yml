#Build a Docker Image and push it to docker hub using AWS Codebuild with github as a source provider.
version: 0.2

phases:

  pre_build: 
    commands:
      - chmod +x build-image.sh push-image.sh # Chmod +x command renders *build-image.sh* and *push-image.sh* files executable.
      - ./build-image.sh #CodeBuild will build the docker image

  build:
    commands:
      - ./push-image.sh #CodeBuild login to Docker Hub and push the image to Docker hub repository.

##Generally most buildspec.yml files are written such that we have the following phases:
# 1) pre_build phase: In this phase, CodeBuild login to Docker Hub.
# 2) build phase: In this phase CodeBuild builds the Docker image.
# 3) post_build phase: In this phase CodeBuild push the Docker image to Docker Hub repository.

# NB: Do check the *build-image.sh* file and see what is explained there.



                             ## STEPS !!!
# 1) Create a Docker hub repository. The repository will habor the image to be pushed from github.
# 2) Go to AWS service, search for CodeBuild, Create a codebuild project:
# - a) For source, select Github.
# - b) For repository, select "Repository in my GitHub account" then go to your github account and select the repo name.
# - c) For Primary source webhook events, check "Rebuild every time a code change is pushed to this repository" This will trigger codebuild automatically whenever a push is made on the required branch.
# - d) For Environment, select environment image.
# - e) For operating system, select ubuntu.
# - f) For Runtime, select standarg
# - g) For image, select the latest version.
# - h) Select prilledged to execute docker commands inside codebuild.

# 3) Create environment variables in CodeBuild, put the:
# - a) value of DOKER_HUB_USERNAME as the Docker hub user name.
# - b) value of DOCKER_HUB_REPO_NAME as the repository name in Dockerhub.
# - c) value of IMAGE_TAG, as latest.
# - d) value of $DOKER_HUB_PASSWORD as the Docker Acces Token.


# 4) Set IAM permisions for Codebuild to login to AWS ECR. To set IAM permissions:
   # (i) Go to IAM service dash board,
   # (ii) Click on Policies,
   # (iii) Search for *AmazonEC2containerRegistryFullAccess* on the search bar,
   # (iv) Select the policy,
   # (vi) Click on *action* and select *attach* to  grant the full access policy to codebuild,
   # (vii) Select the name of the project you just created on codebuild, and click on *attach policy*.
   # (viii) click on *start build* to start building the image.
